<p>For me the essence of Delftware is a blue figure withits shadow. For example we may see a playing child always with its shadow. Thus, I started to place a ball on a tile and painted the shadow under the ball. In this way form and tile became connected. The drawing on a tile is two dimensional; I made it into a three dimensional form. Just like in fairy tales figures step out of their flat images at 12 midnight (and tea pots start to dance).<p>
